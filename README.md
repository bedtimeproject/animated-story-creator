# Animated Story Creator

This tool helps to create animated stories. Created by Alexander Burdiss,
this tool outputs JSON files that can be uploaded to the Animated Story
module on the Bedtime Project website (www.bedtimeproject.org)

## A note before starting

Do not refresh your browser while using this tool, as you will lose your
progress.

This tool will only render if you have two or more stanzas.

## Creating A story

Global options exist on the top of the form. These items control a lot of data
throughout the application.

Items contained within a border control a specific section. Some items are
repeatable, and you can add multiple of them. Repeatable elements are removable,
but not drag-and-drop-able. When you remove an item from this tool, it is gone
for good.

Images can be added from the select list (preferred), or via a URL. The URL
of the external image should end in an image file format, such as .png or .jpg

After making changes in the form, click the blue render button at the bottom
to load all your changes in to the story.

## Saving a story, Loading a story.

After creating your story, you can save it to your local desktop by clicking
the download button. This will download a JSON object that you can then upload
to the tool at a later date, to continue work on it. To load a story, select
it from the browse button, then click upload. This action will erase all data
in the form.
